# Cosmic Pathfinder ðŸš€

A C# .NET console application that counts all possible paths and finds the shortest path from an astronaut's starting position (`S`) to a space station (`F`) on a cosmic grid, avoiding asteroids (`X`).

## Features

- **Path Counting**: Uses DFS to count all valid paths.
- **Shortest Path**: Finds the minimal steps using BFS.
- **Visualization**: Displays the shortest path on the grid with step numbers.
- **CSV Export**: Generates a report of the path for analysis.
